# Liquid BTC on Oasis Sapphire
</center>

This project allows you to deposit and withdraw Bitcoin on the Oasis Sapphire
confidential blockchain. Deposits of specific sizes (powers of 2) can be
converted into [LiquidBTC](token/contracts/LiquidBTC.sol), an ERC-20 compatible
token, which can in return be exchanged for real BTC.

It uses an on-chain Bitcoin SPV light-client to verify deposits have been made
to addresses generated by the [BTCDeposit](token/contracts/BTCDeposit.sol)
contract. To redeem the underlying BTC a deposit can be 'burned' which reveals
the secret key and address to the holder, meaning 'un-burned' BTC deposits can
be freely traded or converted to & from LiquidBTC tokens because the secret key
can't leak without it being evident.
